Core Gameplay Loop:

DAY PHASE (1–3 minutes)

Explore town buildings (saloon, sheriff’s office, general store, etc.)

Loot weapons, ammo, and supplies

Set traps (optional: place bear traps, board doors)

Prepare for nightfall

NIGHT PHASE (2–4 minutes)

Zombies spawn in waves

Survive until dawn

Repair or upgrade between waves

Repeat Until Dead

Each new day gets harder: faster, tougher, or more zombies

Optional: Leaderboard or score-based system (Must have to make it more interactive).


Randomized loot spawns
